# Interactive Audio Bible
The first motive to start the project is to help visually-challenged Tamil people, as to enable them with *Tamil Holy Bible* in **Audio** mode. 
There were many audio Bible on internet, many people have invested lots in recording the audio of Human reading the Bible, but it is very difficult for the people to use as you cannot randomly access any verse, as traversing the entire bible by next button in audio player would be difficult. 

The vision of this project is to complete the following:

- [x] Make the app Visually challenged user-friendly (audio feedback)
- [x] Enable voice command to access book/chapter/verse in Bible
- [ ] To retrieve the information faster in span 3 seconds.
- [ ] To build Android app,  or small radio type machine so that it reaches everyone.
- [x] Provide this app free of cost for V-Challenged people.
- [ ] To build similar app for various other languauges, Currently works only in Tamil.

The Bible verses are taken from the Github user **godlytalias** from the Tamil repository [Here](https://github.com/godlytalias/Bible-Database/blob/master/Tamil/bible.sql). Thank you godlytailas!
